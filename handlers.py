# that don't fit directly into the main smart_bot.py flow, or it can be removed
# if all handler logic is now fully contained within smart_bot.py.
# For now, it serves as a placeholder and confirmation that its previous content
# regarding frequency settings is superseded by the logic in smart_bot.py.
# If there were other functions in your original handlers.py that were not related
# to frequency and are still needed, they would remain here and should be
# refactored to use `context.application.bot_data` for shared data access
# and avoid circular dependencies with smart_bot.py.
# Based on the content you provided, it was primarily about frequency.
